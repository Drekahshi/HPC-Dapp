        <h1>JANI Token: Blockchain-Powered Conservation & Environmental Regeneration</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>JANI Hisa is a hedera -powered database framework designed to incentivize environmental conservation efforts, with a strong focus on conservation, protection, preservation and restoration through reforestation, afforestation, agroforestry, and sustainable land management practices on both land and sea. Built on the energy-efficient blockchain and scaled on, JANI ecosystem fosters transparency, decentralized governance, and financial sustainability for Community Forest Associations (CFAs) eg seedling user groups and other CFA user groups and environmental stakeholders.</p>

        <p>Additionally, JANI promotes youth and women empowerment by providing leadership roles and financial incentives. Each verified tree planted results in the minting of one JANI token, directly linking environmental restoration with financial rewards. JANI ecosystem believes in carbon footprint reduction using nature based solution individuals, businesses and companies can join us in our valiant mission. This is JANI's economic model, governance framework, verification mechanisms, and strategies for scalability and adoption.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Challenges in Conservation</h3>

        <p>Current conservation initiatives face several key challenges:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lack of Transparency</strong> — No clear verification system for conservation efforts</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Instability</strong> — Community-led projects rely heavily on inconsistent funding sources</li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholder Fragmentation</strong> — Lack of coordination among conservation groups, government bodies, and businesses</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Offset Inefficiencies</strong> — Unverifiable impact metrics hinder the adoption of carbon offset programs</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Inclusion</strong> — Insufficient opportunities for youth and women in conservation initiatives</li>
            <li><strong>Long-Term Viability Issues</strong> — Absence of structured financial models for sustainability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 JANI's Solution</h3>

        <p>JANI Token leverages blockchain technology to resolve these issues by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Establishing a <strong>decentralized database ledger</strong> for tracking all conservation activities that use the Jani system</li>
            <li>Implementing <strong>smart contract-driven reward mechanisms</strong> for verified conservation efforts</li>
            <li>Integrating <strong>IoT and AI verification</strong> to ensure proper tree planting and growth monitoring</li>
            <li>Creating a <strong>self-sustaining financial model</strong> that minimizes reliance on grants</li>
            <li>Promoting <strong>youth and women empowerment</strong> through governance roles and financial incentives. JANI promotes youth and women empowerment by providing leadership roles and financial incentives. Jani ecosystem supports microfinance women and youth groups offering them better staking APY and Jani blockchain infrastructure in their various microfinance group (chamas) which makes them transparent and accountable</li>
            <li><strong>Partnering with CFAs, governments, and NGOs</strong> to drive real-world adoption</li>
            <li>Integrating <strong>carbon offset markets</strong> for corporate sustainability compliance</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>3. Token Economics & Utility</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Token Utility</h3>

        <p>JANI Token provides multiple use cases, including:</p>

        <h4>Governance and Voting</h4>
        <p>Community participation through DAOs.</p>

        <h4>Staking Rewards</h4>
        <p>Incentives for long-term holders.</p>

        <h4>Carbon Offset Utility</h4>
        <p>Tradable credits for corporate sustainability and work with DOVU and Guardian. For a hectares of confirmed bamboo a unique NFT is minted that backs up Jani token to co2 offset activity in JANI ecosystem. This NFT will be a Co2 offset meme which will be burnt annually. It will serve as a measure for co2 offset in Jani ecosystem especially in the Jani token eg 1 Jani token is 10 kg of co2 offset annually and it will increase depending on co2 offset activities annually and growth of planted bamboo. Farmers will be paid in Jani token for their co2 offset activities. This will be a way of rewarding and unlock liquidity that lying idle utilizing blockchain technology.</p>

        <h4>NFT-based Conservation Tracking</h4>
        <p>Unique digital assets linked to conservation projects.</p>

        <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and addressing it requires more than just scientific solutions—it demands creativity, innovation, and community engagement. Art has the unique power to inspire, educate, and mobilize people in ways that data alone cannot. By blending artistic expression with cutting-edge technology, we can create new pathways for environmental advocacy and action.</p>

        <p>Our NFT project are rooted in this belief. Through digital art, we aim to raise awareness about the urgency of climate change and the importance of sustainable practices. Each NFT serves as a visual narrative, telling the story of our planet's fragile ecosystems and the need for collective action. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure transparency and traceability, allowing supporters to see the direct impact of their contributions.</p>

        <p>This ideology is incorporated in JANI Ecosystem, which uses blockchain to incentivize conservation and reforestation. Just as JANI Token connects environmental restoration with financial rewards, our NFTs bridge art and activism, offering a creative way to support climate action. Together, we can harness the power of art and technology to inspire a global movement towards a more sustainable future.</p>

        <p>A conservation NFT will be minted after 100 Jani tokens are minted. Different wallet address that support Jani activities will be given a chance to mint an NFT but must stake Jani tokens. Artist, Generative AI and even photographers will be given a chance to be creative and mint a 1 of 1 NFT. NFT allotment will depend on different factors eg bidding through lock up staking for liquidity, Lottery, Jani proof of work metrics, social media voting, buying a slot, liquidity provision metric, donations etc. Depending on how the NFT allotment process the NFT it can be Stored in a vault, Kept by the owner, Redeemed by the NFT holder, Destroyed after tokenization, Used Separately from the NFT. Join us in this innovative journey, where creativity meets conservation, and every piece of art becomes a step towards healing our planet.</p>

        <h4>Ecosystem Services Payments and Real World Payment</h4>
        <p>Financial rewards for conservation activities and increased utility for users for their day to day life.</p>

        <h4>Corporate Certifications</h4>
        <p>Recognition for companies supporting conservation efforts. Companies that donate and support will receive special certificate in NFT and physical copies that indicate that they are ESG compliant and support Jani ecosystem. Companies that lumber or log wood can pay us to plant trees that they mostly partake logging and we can plant them due to the respective nature of our businesses and still conserve the environment. Automotives and companies that emit co2 can purchase Jani token to show their commitment in reducing their carbon footprint efforts and can stake and earn rewards. JANI financial utility down to its basic state will be a unit of account a nominal unit of measure to hold value of the item it will be a medium of exchange and a store of value.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Token Distribution & Inflation Control</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Supply:</strong> 50 million JANI tokens</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Minting Cap:</strong> 1 million tokens</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Minted Token Allocation:</h4>

        <h5><strong>50% - Staking Rewards</strong></h5>

        <p>The network shall be the pool operator and will be in charge of managing the pool and setting the pool fee. The annual staking rewards will be a percentage of the total supply. Slashing conditions will be for malicious actors. Penalty for early withdrawal is no reward. Coins can be locked for at least 21 days. One can join as an individual or joint if it is a group since there will be different pool groups. Minimum staking will be 1 coins. Ecosystem builders will earn more staking rewards eg validators, auditors local stake holders compared to other parties.</p>

        <p>Stackers reward = stackers contribution / total staked in pool * total reward - pool fee</p>

        <p>Example: If the total reward earned by the pool is 1000 coins and the pool fee is 50 coins and the total staked by the pool 10,000 coins and the stakers contribution is 500 coins he will earn 47.5 coins in 42 days.</p>

        <p>Annually the staking reward will be stackers contribution / total staked in network * total stacking reward</p>

        <h5><strong>40% - Tree-planting Fund</strong></h5>
        <p>The global DAO shall decide which conservation project shall get the allocation.</p>

        <h5><strong>10% - Liquidity Incentives</strong></h5>
        <p>Liquidity providers will be rewarded for their liquidity provision on DEXes.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Deflationary Mechanisms</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Token Reinvestment:</strong> 2% of each transaction will be used in conservation NFT projects</li>
            <li><strong>Buyback Program:</strong> 10% of transaction fees reinvested in buybacks and fund bamboo projects</li>
            <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> 3% of transaction fees will be used for insurance against any unforeseen risk that may occur in the seedlings nursery or when planted in the field eg Dying plants, vandalized plants etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The rest of the transaction fees will be used in the network system infrastructure, Stable Jani liquidity and for overcollateralization for good risk management in network liquidity.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>4. Governance & Decentralization</h2>

        <h3>4.1 DAO Structure</h3>

            <li><strong>Voting Model:</strong> One-member-one-vote</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership Roles:</strong> Chairman, Secretary, Treasurer, Validator, Environmental Auditor</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> Ensures youth and women participate in governance</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Global DAO (G-DAO)</h4>
        <p>Manages protocol upgrades, treasury, and partnerships.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voting Model:</strong> Quadratic voting (prevents wealth-based dominance)</li>
            <li><strong>Key Committees:</strong> Executive, Technical, Conservation</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> On-chain voting and arbitration committee interventions. Dispute Resolution: If disputes arise, an arbitration process using multiple validators is triggered</li>

        <p>JANI ecosystem will incorporate grants and donations, the type of donation will include cash donations in kind donations and also stock donations. The ecosystem will incorporate grants of various types they will include government grants, foundation grants, corporate, crowdfunding and also online environmental grants. There will be various types of grants eg ecosystem grants and donation, independent and autonomous network free grants where the funding is not from the network but from a third party, there will always be collaborative grants between the network and any third party well wisher.</p>

        <p>For transparency and accountability JANI Ledger will be used to track how the money will switch hands in the ecosystem. Each user group will have its own wallet address account which will be overseen by the treasure and one group can have various accounts they will have stealth addresses and ring confidential transaction to suit their need. The network will create a decentralized online portal.</p>

        <p>For those who wish to be anonymous and their Identity kept secret we will respect their choice. For those philanthropic people who wish their names to be publicly shown will receive some recognition for their good will. Various types will be integrated in the ecosystem eg 1 time donations, Recurring, cooperate sponsorship, In kind donations and many more. All donations will be tracked and their contributions will be posted and updates given on impact of their contributions. The donations level will also be included eg bronze, silver, Gold, Platinum. Certificates will be issued for recognition in paper and tokenized and respective beneficiaries can post their names in social media and may more. Incentive donor programs where they can get good staking APY. Donor impact tracking.</p>

        <h2>8. JANI Green Bonds for Bamboo Reforestation</h2>

        <p>JANI Green Bonds can finance bamboo reforestation, integrating blockchain-based conservation with sustainable funding. Bamboo is an ideal green investment due to its high carbon sequestration, rapid growth, and soil restoration benefits. They will be planted in batches that fit a hectare.</p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Green Bonds</strong> — The government of Kenya Issues Green bonds to Jani ecosystem, allowing to fund bamboo projects and other conservation projects in Jani ecosystem</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Contract-Based Funding</strong> — Funds are released only when verified growth milestones are met</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of Growth (PoG) for Bamboo</strong> — IoT and AI track CO₂ absorption, survival rates, and biomass expansion</li>
            <li><strong>Carbon Credit Trading</strong> — Bamboo-linked carbon offsets can be sold to ESG investors & DeFi platforms (e.g., KlimaDAO)</li>
            <li><strong>DAO Governance</strong> — The JANI DAO ensures transparent allocation of funds to bamboo projects</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Implementation Plan:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ololua Forest Bamboo Project</strong> — Fund bamboo planting for carbon sequestration & land restoration</li>
            <li><strong>Community Forest Associations (CFAs)</strong> — Earn JANI tokens for maintaining bamboo forests</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional Investors</strong> — Buy JANI Token which will have integrated green bonds Green Bonds to support climate-friendly investments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Develop smart contracts for bamboo bond issuance</li>
            <li>Partner with carbon credit buyers & sustainability funds</li>
            <li>Scale bamboo projects via CFAs & government partnerships</li>
        </ul>
